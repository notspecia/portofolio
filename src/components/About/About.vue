        <p class="mb-3">Hey! I'm Speciale Gabriele, a Web developer with two years of experience, focusing on
            front-end development. I am also an open-source enthusiast, having participated in many open-source projects
            related to the Nuxt and Vue
            ecosystems. These experiences have given me a deep understanding of Vue, allowing me to develop high-quality
            code more quickly and adapt to new technologies faster.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about solving complex and challenging engineering problems and helping teams build more
            efficient workflows.

            Hey! I'm Speciale Gabriele, a Web Developer with two years of experience, mainly focused on
            front-end development with Vue 3 and its ecosystem. These experiences have strengthened my ability to write
            clean, efficient code and to adapt quickly to new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            While my background is rooted in front-end development, I am now expanding my expertise towards backend
            development, aiming to grow as a full-stack developer. My current stack combines Vue 3 for the frontend with
            emerging backend skills, allowing me to contribute across the full application lifecycle.
